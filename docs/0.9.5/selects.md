The variations on Select
------------------------

Select statements return an immutable Query\[T\] that  
is itself a Queryable\[T\] and a lazy Iterable\[T\].

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
class Artist(val id: Long, val name:String) {

  def songs =  
  from(MusicDb.songs)(s => where(s.artistId === id) select(s))
}
]]>

</script>

The laziness here means that the query is sent to the database only  
when starting iteration, or in other words, when Iterable.iterator is
called.

The select function takes any legal Scala expression whose  
type determines the generic parameter of the Query\[R\]

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
def select[R](r: =>R): R
]]>

</script>

The select expression will be evaluated for every row returned by the
query.

It is also possible to select with alternative (shorter but less
generic) syntax:

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
class Song(var title: String, var artistId: Long) extends KeyedEntity {

  import MusicDb._ // the schema can be imported in the scope

  // A shorter syntax for single table queries:
  def artist = artists.where(a => a.id === artistId).single

  // lookup by key is available because Artist extends
  // KeyedEntity[Long]:
  def lookupArtist = artists.lookup(artistId)
}
]]>

</script>

Note that the .lookup\[K\](k: K) i.e. lookup by key method on a
Table\[T\] is only  
available for Table\[T\] that are of the form :
Table\[KeyedEntity\[K\]\]

The classes Artist and Song in this example are part of a one to many
relation  
that can be accessed via the methods.

Nesting Sub Queries
-------------------

For the next examples, the following query will be nested as an inner
query  
into other queries :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
def songsInPlaylistOrder =
  from(playlistElements, songs)((ple, s) =>
  where(ple.playlistId = id and ple.songId = s.id)
  select(s)
  orderBy(ple.songNumber asc))
]]>

</script>

### Sub Queries in the From clause :

The from clause takes Queryable\[T\]’s, a trait of Table\[T\] View\[T\]
**and** Query\[T\].  
Notice the Query\[Song\] **funkAndLatinJazz.songsInPlaylistOrder** in
the from clause :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
val songsFromThe60sInFunkAndLatinJazzPlaylist2 =
  from(funkAndLatinJazz.songsInPlaylistOrder)(s=>
  where(s.id === 123)
  select(s))
]]>

</script>

### Sub Queries in the Where clause :

Joins can also be nested in the where clause just like in SQL :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
val songsFromThe60sInFunkAndLatinJazzPlaylist =
  from(songs)(s=>
    where(s.id in
      from(funkAndLatinJazz.songsInPlaylistOrder)
      (s2 => select(s2.id)))
    select(s))

for(s <- songsFromThe60sInFunkAndLatinJazzPlaylist)
  println(s.title + " : " + s.year)
]]>

</script>

The SQL generated for the above statement is :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: sql">

<![CDATA[
Select
  Song1.year as Song1_year,
  Song1.title as Song1_title,
  Song1.filePath as Song1_filePath,
  Song1.artistId as Song1_artistId,
  Song1.id as Song1_id
From
  Song Song1
Where
  (Song1.id in
    (Select
    q3.Song5_id as q3_Song5_id
From
  (Select
    Song5.year as Song5_year,
    Song5.title as Song5_title,
    Song5.filePath as Song5_filePath,
    Song5.artistId as Song5_artistId,
    Song5.id as Song5_id
  From
    PlaylistElement PlaylistElement4,
    Song Song5
  Where
    ((PlaylistElement4.playlistId = ?) and (PlaylistElement4.songId = Song5.id))
    Order By
      PlaylistElement4.songNumber Asc) q3))
]]>

</script>

Doing a 3 level nested join is by no means necessary and serves  
no other purposes than demonstration.

In addition to the in() operator, exists() and notExists() can be used
in a  
where clause. They correspond to EXISTS and NOT EXISTS in SQL. Any
query  
nested with in(), exists(), or notExists() can also refer to queries in
an  
outer scope.

For example:

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
val studentsWithAnAddress =
  from(students)(s =>
    where(exists(from(addresses)((a) => where(s.addressId === a.id)
    select(a.id))))
    select(s))
]]>

</script>

The SQL generated for the above statement is :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: sql">

<![CDATA[
Select
  Student8.name as Student8_name,  
  Student8.age as Student8_age,  
  Student8.isMultilingual as Student8_isMultilingual,  
  Student8.lastName as Student8_lastName,  
  Student8.id as Student8_id,  
  Student8.addressId as Student8_addressId,  
  Student8.gender as Student8_gender  
From  
  Student Student8  
Where  
  (exists(Select
      Address11.id as Address11_id  
  From  
    Address Address11  
  Where  
    (Student8.addressId = Address11.id)))
]]>

</script>

Select Distinct
---------------

Calling the **.distinct** method on a Query\[\] creates a copy of it
that has a ‘distinct’ select clause :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
from(songs)(s => select(&(s.title))).distinct  
]].

</script>

For Update
----------

Calling the **.forUpdate** method on a Query\[\] creates a copy of it
that has a ‘forUpdate’ locking directive :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala">

<![CDATA[
aTable.where(t => t.aField === aValue).forUpdate
]]>

</script>
